You don't need to look into any test cases not mentioned here. If you fix something, mention so in the comments.
Format for this file is as specified in the next line.
filename -> line in the code that is causing trouble	//my intuition as to what's wrong

test5 -> return [x.get()];		//plug-in problem. Map is empty.
test6 -> return [x.set1("world").pi1()];	//plug-in problem. Map is empty.
test7 -> class RaceCar(pos: Land) extends Car 	//Unable to parse the program successfully.
test9 -> for (p in lst) 	//plug-in problem
test10 -> fun makeItADouble() : Pizza<Pizza<A>> = Pizza<Pizza<A>>(Pizza<A>(y));		//plug-in problem.
test14 -> fun getT() : Integer = getRandom();		//The method getRandom from the interface is not in the context of the MyClass2. 
													//One of the functions of the class is calling another function of the same class. 
													//We might need to add the functions to the context as soon as we come across it.
test15 -> return [x];		//plug-in problem. Map is empty.											
test16 -> x := SuperSingleton<String>("hello").set("foo").get();		//Plug-in problem. The superclass for this class has an empty map.
test17 -> lst := [x, y];		//lst is stored as an Iterable<Thing> but it should be an Iterable of Foo.
test19 -> fun lol(ab : Aa&Bb) : String 			//When we have Aa&Bb as parent type for CuType, it's id is not set.

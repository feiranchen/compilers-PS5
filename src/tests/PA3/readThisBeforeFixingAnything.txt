You don't need to look into any test cases not mentioned here. If you fix something, mention so in the comments.
Format for this file is as specified in the next line.
filename -> line in the code that is causing trouble	//my intuition as to what's wrong

test5 -> return [x.get()];		//plug-in problem. Map is empty.
test6 -> return [x.set1("world").pi1()];	//plug-in problem. Map is empty.
test7 -> class RaceCar(pos: Land) extends Car 	//Not sure where it's getting rejected.
test9 -> for (p in lst) 	//plug-in problem
test10 -> fun makeItADouble() : Pizza<Pizza<A>> = Pizza<Pizza<A>>(Pizza<A>(y));		//plug-in problem.
test14 -> 					//Unsure why it is rejected because we fixed a couple of things. But don't think it's a plug-in problem
test15 -> return [x];		//plug-in problem. Map is empty.											
test16 -> x := SuperSingleton<String>("hello").set("foo").get();		//Plug-in problem. The superclass for this class has an empty map.
test17 -> lst := [x, y];		//lst is stored as an Iterable<Thing> but it should be an Iterable of Foo.
test19 -> fun lol(ab : Aa&Bb) : String 			//When we have Aa&Bb as parent type for CuType, it's id is not set.
